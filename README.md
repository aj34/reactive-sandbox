reactive-sandbox
================

This is my sandbox project for playing with [RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS) and [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/).

It uses [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) and [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) and allows for the use of es6 (via [6to5](https://github.com/6to5/6to5))
